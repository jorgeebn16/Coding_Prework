My Favorite Musician

In this activity, you'll pay tribute to your favorite musician or band by building a simple fan page. That's right—you're about to code a website from scratch!

For this task, you'll use HTML to build out your page. It might not look amazing, but where would you be without a skeleton? If you get stuck, use Google to find what you need. Knowing how to learn new technologies on the fly is an important skill that all developers use—even experienced ones. Use this as an opportunity to practice that skill!
